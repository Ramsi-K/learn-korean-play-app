# Frontend â€” Lang Portal

## Difficulty: Level 200

## Business Goal  

A language learning school wants to build a prototype of a learning portal which will act as three things:  

- **Inventory of possible vocabulary** that can be learned.  
- **A record store** providing correct and wrong scores on practice vocabulary.  
- **A unified launchpad** to launch different learning apps.  

You have been tasked with creating the **frontend API** of the application.  
The **fractional CTO** has strongly recommended that you settle on a **frontend stack that is commonly adopted and optimized for AI prototyping services.**  

The **frontend application should be powered by your backend API.**

## Technical Restrictions  

The technical stack should be the following:  

- **Typescript** (statically typed JavaScript)  
- **Tailwind CSS** (CSS framework)  
- **Vite.js** (frontend tool)  
- **ShadCN** (UI components)
