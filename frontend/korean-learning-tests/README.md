# Korean Language Learning Tests

This project is designed to implement test coverage and a mock backend for a Korean language learning application. It includes various testing strategies using Jest and React Testing Library, as well as MSW for mocking API requests.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd korean-learning-tests
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```
   npm test
   ```

## Testing Guidelines

- **Unit Tests**: Located in `src/__tests__/unit/`, these tests verify the functionality of individual functions and hooks.
- **Component Tests**: Located in `src/__tests__/components/`, these tests ensure that components render correctly and handle user interactions.
- **Integration Tests**: Located in `src/__tests__/integration/`, these tests cover end-to-end user flows.

## Mock Backend

The project uses MSW (Mock Service Worker) to mock API requests. The handlers are defined in `src/mocks/handlers.ts`, and the server is set up in `src/mocks/server.ts`. This allows for realistic testing without relying on a live backend.

## Test Coverage

To check test coverage, run:
```
npm test -- --coverage
```

This will provide a coverage report indicating which parts of the code are tested.
